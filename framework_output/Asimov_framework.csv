Overall,"{'output_text': ""Asimov is a startup that was spun off from research at MIT. Its mission is to advance humanity's ability to design living systems and enable biotechnologies with significant societal benefits. Asimov is focused on bridging the gap between digital and biological realms by creating computer-aided biology design tools. The company is developing a synthetic biology platform that encompasses both cells and software. This platform aims to design and manufacture next-generation therapeutics, including biologics, cell/gene therapies, and RNA.\n\nThe main problem that Asimov addresses is the need for better tools to design and program biology. Traditional biotech research and development often rely on cycles of trial-and-error, which can be slow and expensive. Asimov aims to provide a platform that allows for the design, simulation, and optimization of genetic systems in a more reliable manner. By using automation tools for biological circuit design, bioengineers can debug biological circuits with the same level of detail as software debugging. Asimov has also developed modular biological circuit components that do not have adverse reactions to other parts of the cell. This allows for easier downstream use by circuit designers and facilitates accurate simulation of biological circuits.\n\nIn summary, Asimov exists to revolutionize the field of biotechnology by providing tools and techniques that enable the design and programming of living systems. Its platform aims to overcome the limitations of traditional computing techniques in the biotech industry and accelerate the development of programmable medicines and other biotechnologies with significant societal benefits.""}"
